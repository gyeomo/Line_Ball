# Line_Ball

This is a project using Unity for C #.

It is a 2D Android game.



The game method is to draw a line to make the ball roll and move it to the target point.

**Drawing a line creates a collation that aligns with the line.**

The way to draw lines is free.

Lines are affected by gravity, so it is better to draw them on the floor.


You can check the direction of the map with the direction buttons below.

You can erase the last line drawn with the restore button.

If you press the start button at the bottom, the line can not be drawn and the ball falls.
